<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    I am an aspiring software developer that has experience in the workforce. I finished my BA, Philosophy in 2013 from UBC. 
    While attending UBC I was in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserves program as a Mobile Equipment Operator. Upon graduation I 
    worked full-time for just over a year with 39 SVC BN as a dispatcher, truck driver, and instructor. I later took my experience
    in transportation and logistics to the Deutsche Bahn group, creating shipping solutions for companies like Costco and Aritzia.
    After selling to companies in Germany, China and India, I quickly burnt out after 2-years of being on multuple time zones.
    I moved to the federal government and became a Passport Officer, where I took training in lie detection, French and policy 
    administraiton, working in both Calgary and Vancouver. During my time as a civil servant, I was severely impacted by the 
    Phoenix pay crisis. I left after seeing my friends re-tooling to become software developers after their undergrads, and have
    not regretted my decision since due to the abundance and diversity of opportunity in the sector.
